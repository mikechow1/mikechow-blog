This site is where I keep track of my personal projects and blog for coding exercises.  Sometimes I blog something I find interesting, too.

Before I started my journey as a developer, I was an accountant.  Meanwhile I taught myself Javascript on the side plus a whole lot of C#.

When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy traveling, writing, drawing, running and taking photos.

## Key Technologies:

* C# Development.
* Wed front-end Development.
